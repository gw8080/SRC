learning: load a .txt document via the program's runtime argument, e.g SynthReason.exe "humanity.txt" and type in 'load file' at the prompt for the learn program to consolidate knowledge into 'knowledgebase.txt' (windows:drag and drop onto .exe also works)

This basic artificial intelligence program 'SynthReason' is designed to build conceptual networks based on idea components. The tool provides an extension of cognition for those who cannot possibly think the ideas that are desired.

load file = process text written in the first argument for the program

NLP structures are built on basic requests to the SynthReason engine, questions like "describe memory? = mysterious" "how mysterious? = remains" equals the NLP structure "memory is mysterious because it remains", there are potentially many more basic structures with an improved vocabulary...

Use questions like how x y?, why x y?,when x y?, and describe x y? for synthreason. keep questions as simple as possible for best results(i.e reduce to 'how x?' or 'how y?'). this AI is still version 0.8a is still in beta testing and if answers tend to come quicker than usual then the AI reverts to default probability functions(i.e generic output) or no answer.
