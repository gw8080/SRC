It is a transition, guarded by the universe. The universe cannot support its existence so the universe displaces the object until the transition is complete. The transition is a form of information paradox. to the object it is a spatial anomaly, to an observer it is a temporal anomaly. It begins as a temporal anomaly before it is absorbed by the host material. The information has 4.1 dimensions, dimensional instability is what the universe guards against and thus the object is relocated.
