This basic artificial intelligence program 'SynthReason' is designed to build conceptual networks based on idea components. The tool provides an extension of cognition for those who cannot possibly think the ideas that are desired.


Instructions for use.

Please have "learn" process a new knowledgebase before asking it a question. (eg. learn "learning resourcetextfile.txt")

The 'load file' command reads a text document which is passed through the command line arguments. (windows:drag and drop *.txt file onto the SynthReason application) and organises the text into a format synthreason can process.


Use questions like how x y?, why x y?,when x y?, and describe x y? for synthreason. keep questions as simple as possible for best results(i.e reduce to 'how x?' or 'how y?'). this AI is still version 0.8a is still in beta testing and if answers tend to come quicker than usual then the AI reverts to default probability functions(i.e generic output) or no answer.


The knowledgebase file stores prelearned text into the Synthreason kb format.

Request descriptors or the information manipulation headers for the SynthReason engine are the configurable keywords:
why
describe
when
count
what who
feel
where
how





vocabulary files are updatable, which are the information manipulation footers.
A list of the manipulation footers:
concept
objects
names
reason
time
places
emotion
actions
descriptions
numbers
 
a list of administration/diagnostic commands:

show userinputall = show user input
E41B = clear all memory
show answerstring = display knowledgebase
load file = process text written in the first argument for the program(windows:drag and drop)


*Approximate processing times 15-20 minutes per 512kb of pre-processed data(Knowledgebase.txt)
